# Final story assignment

For your final story, you will have to provide the following on your line edit day.

1. A completed story, ready for publication. Drafts, excuses, etc. will not be accepted because the line edits will be during Dead Week. There will not be time to work further on the story. 
2. A complete Jupyter Notebook, documenting your analysis steps. Your Jupyter Notebook must clearly show how you arrived at the numbers used in your story, and include sufficient comments to explain each step.
3. The data and your Jupyter Notebook uploaded to GitHub, so others could follow your steps and use your data.

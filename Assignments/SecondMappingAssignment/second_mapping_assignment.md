# Second Mapping Assignment

An editor has just approached you about a story idea they have. [They heard this podcast](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/he-called-it-americas-worst-place-to-live-now-hes-moving-there/) of this Washington Post reporter who wrote a story about [The Worst Place In America To Live](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/17/every-county-in-america-ranked-by-natural-beauty/), which is in Minnesota. In the podcast, and in the story, the ranking was based on the USDA's Natural Amenities Index. The map that the Washington Post published also made Nebraska out to be a pretty rough place to live. 

Your editor wants to know: 

1. What are the 50 worst places in America to live based on natural beauty?
2. How many of Top 50 Worst places are in Nebraska?
3. Where are they?
4. And can we have a map like the Washington Post map?

## To complete this assignment

You will need to submit the following to Blackboard to complete this assignment:

1. A Jupyter Notebook showing your steps in Agate to find the 50 worst places, complete with documentation on what each step does.
2. A map thematically shaded by good or bad it is to live in a place. Submit a png graphic of it.

To do this, you'll need the Natural Amenities Index. [That index can be found on the USDA's website](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale.aspx). Because I am a benevolent god, [I've cleaned up the Excel file they provide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qfv8xn4cffwqtvg/naturalamenities.csv?dl=0) to make importing into Agate easy. 

[You will also need a county map](http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2014/shp/cb_2014_us_county_5m.zip).

If you are lost on joining data to a map, [this tutorial is quite helpful](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/performing_table_joins.html).

# Truth, truth and data journalism

While I'm out, you are to read the following.

1. [True Facts, Maybe](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/true-facts-maybe/)
2. [What the Fox Knows](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/)
3. [Data Journalism Needs to Up Its Own Standards](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/alberto-cairo-data-journalism-needs-to-up-its-own-standards/)
4. [Chapter 5 of the Curious Journalists Guide to Data](https://towcenter.gitbooks.io/curious-journalist-s-guide-to-data/content/communication/index.html)


In a one-page essay, drawing from and citing the readings, answer the following questions: What epistemic responsibilites do data journalists have to the truth? To readers? What extra responsibilities do you take on as a data journalist? Do those responsibilities make things better or more difficult for journalists? Do those responsibilites outweigh the value of data journalism?
